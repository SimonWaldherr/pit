===========
A command line tool for (micro)service developers that allows them to define container functionality by writing examples and testing against them.

- Develop a single service in isolation by mocking all dependencies and set up the addresses as environment variables with a single command.

- When dependencies are mocked you can run the test cases quickly and reliably to make sure the service is implemented correctly.
